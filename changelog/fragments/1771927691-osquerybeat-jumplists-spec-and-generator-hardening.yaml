kind: enhancement
summary: Add elastic_jumplists spec integration and harden osquerybeat generation workflow

description: |
  - Added elastic_jumplists table spec and shared types, generated table/docs wiring, and
    migrated jumplists glue to generated RegisterGenerateFunc/GetGenerateFunc flow.
  - Extended generated table registry/getter signatures to pass ResilientClient and wired it
    through osquery-extension table registration.
  - Added generated osquery-extension README support in gentables to keep tables/views docs in sync.
  - Added osquerybeat mage Generate target and made Check depend on it for generation consistency.
  - Updated jumplists generator to use local cached source files by default, with on-demand refresh
    via `-refresh-sources` (and `JUMPLISTS_REFRESH_SOURCES=true mage generate`), plus enforced
    gofmt/goimports formatting of generated jumplists files.
