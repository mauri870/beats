# Osquery Extension for Elastic

This osquery extension provides additional custom tables that enhance osquery's capabilities with Elastic-specific functionality. The extension is designed to work seamlessly with Osquerybeat and provides deep system insights across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Overview

The extension adds several custom tables to osquery that provide:
- Browser history analysis across multiple browsers
- Host system information access from containers (groups, users, processes)
- Deep file analysis and security auditing on macOS
- Windows Amcache inventory and normalized application view
- Windows Jump List parsing for recent and pinned entries

## Supported Platforms

| Name | Type | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|------|------|-------|-------|---------|
{{- range .Entries}}
| `{{.Name}}` | {{.Type}} | {{.Linux}} | {{.Darwin}} | {{.Windows}} |
{{- end}}

## Tables

{{- range .Tables}}
- [{{.Name}}]({{.DocPath}})
{{- end}}

## Views

- [{{.Name}}]({{.DocPath}})
{{- end}}

## Building and Installation

### Build the Extension

From the osquerybeat directory:

```bash
# Build for current platform
mage buildext

# The extension binary will be created at:
# Linux: ext/osquery-extension/build/linux/osquery-extension
# macOS: ext/osquery-extension/build/darwin/osquery-extension
# Windows: ext/osquery-extension/build/windows/osquery-extension.ext
```

### Using with Osquery

The extension is automatically loaded by Osquerybeat. To use it manually with osquery:

```bash
# Start osquery with the extension
osqueryi --extension /path/to/osquery-extension [--allow-unsafe]

# Verify tables are loaded
osqueryi> .tables
  => elastic_browser_history

# Query the tables
osqueryi> SELECT * FROM elastic_browser_history LIMIT 10;
```
